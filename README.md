# Calculus for Machine Learning and Data Science – Calculus  

This repository contains my **handwritten notes, slides, and Python notebooks** from the **Calculus** course in the *Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science Specialization* by [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/).  

The goal of this repo is to **share resources** and help others strengthen their math foundation for **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**.

## 📘 Course Overview  
The Calculus course covers the essential concepts required to understand and implement modern ML/AI algorithms.  
Key topics include:  
- Functions, limits, and continuity  
- Derivatives and gradients  
- The chain rule and partial derivatives  
- Multivariable calculus  
- Optimization and cost functions  
- Gradient descent and applications to ML  

---

## 🚀 Why this repo?  
- To **revisit and polish mathematical foundations** as part of my journey to become an **AI/ML Engineer**.  
- To help peers who want to study Calculus with both **theory + practical notebooks**.  
- To document my progress while preparing for my **upcoming ML/AI internship**.

## 🔗 Next Steps  
This repo is the **second milestone**.  
In the coming weeks, I will complete and share notes + notebooks for the final course in the specialization:  
- **Probability & Statistics**  

Stay tuned 🚀
